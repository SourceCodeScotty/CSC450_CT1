#include<iostream>
// need to get rid of include<conio.h>
// it is an older libary and is not supported on my mac OS

// Standard namespace declaration (make this a comment here)
using namespace std; //tells the complier that I am using std
//This makes it so I don't need to write it in front of cout

// Main Function (make this a comment here)
int main() {
    //Standard Ouput Statement
    cout<<"Welcome to this C++ Program\n" //add a new line
    "I have corrected all errors for this program."; //remove cout as it is redundant
    return 0; //Return 0 instead od end
